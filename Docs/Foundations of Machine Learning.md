### Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a two-model process where computer systems find patterns in massive amounts of data using algorithms and statistical models. Another model is used to recognise the patterns to make predictions or descriptions on new data. In simple terms, machine learning trains a machine to learn without it being programmed to do so.

Machine learning uses algorithms to autonomously create models from data fed into a machine learning platform. Typical programmed systems rely on expertise knowledge in programmed rules, however, when data is changing, the rules are difficult to maintain. **ML provides the ability to learn from increasing volumes of data and provide data driven predictions.**

The performance of an ML algorithm depends on the capability of algorithms turning a dataset into a model. Depending on the task, different algorithms are needed. Additionally, performing the task relies on the quality of the input data to the model.

Machine learning implements two techniques that divide the use of algorithms into different types: **supervised** and **un-supervised** learning.
